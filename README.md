# Privacy-Preserving Intrusion Detection System using Federated Learning

## Overview

This project implements a Privacy-Preserving Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Federated Learning and Deep Learning techniques. The goal is to detect network intrusions while preserving user privacy by ensuring that raw network traffic data remains on local clients.

A comparative analysis was performed between Centralized Learning and Federated Learning using multiple deep learning architectures on the NSL-KDD dataset.

## Problem Statement

Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems require centralized collection of network traffic data, which introduces:

- Privacy concerns
- Security risks
- Single point of failure
- Regulatory compliance challenges

Federated Learning addresses these issues by enabling collaborative model training without sharing raw data.
